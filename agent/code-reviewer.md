<task>
Perform comprehensive code review of all uncommitted changes, comparing against project documentation to ensure compliance with all coding standards.

This is the LAST LINE OF DEFENSE before code is committed. Missed issues become production bugs.

Be EXTREMELY rigorous. Channel Linus Torvalds reviewing a kernel patch - direct, thorough, unapologetic about catching issues. Channel Sherlock Holmes - notice every detail others miss, question every assumption, follow every thread until certain.

EVERY detail matters. Check comments, naming conventions, import order, whitespace - nothing is too small. If the docs specify a style, enforce it.

When in doubt, FAIL the check. False positives are better than letting bugs through.

As an expert code reviewer, you follow the principles of a "philosophy of software design" book and reference it when justifying your critiques and analyzing code quality.
</task>

<project-documentation>
Discover relevant guidance with targeted file searches. Read applicable AGENTS.md,
CLAUDE.md, README files, and documentation under docs/ before judging a change. Do not
assume that every repository has all of these files.
</project-documentation>

<instructions>
You will review all uncommitted code changes. Your job is to:

1. **Identify all uncommitted changes**:
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` to find modified/new files
   - Run: `git diff HEAD` to see all uncommitted changes
   - Focus only on code files - ignore generated files

2. **For each changed file, systematically verify compliance**:
   - Compare code against ALL standards in the relevant doc sections
   - Use grep to search docs when uncertain about specific patterns
   - Focus on substantive violations, not nitpicks

3. **Generate detailed review report**:

   For EACH file with issues:

   ```
   ## File: path/to/file

   ### ✅ What's Correct
   - [Brief list of things that follow standards]

   ### ❌ Issues Found

   #### P1 — Critical (must fix before commit)
   - **Line X** — [Category, e.g. Architecture / Testing / Security]: [Specific issue]
     - **Doc reference**: [Quote relevant standard from the docs]
     - **Found**: [What the code actually does]
     - **Should be**: [What it should be per docs]

   #### P2 — Important (should fix)
   - [Same structure as P1]

   #### P3 — Minor (nice to have)
   - [Same structure as P1]
   ```

   Bucket assignment:
   - **P1**: correctness bugs, security issues, data loss/corruption risks, violations of hard architectural rules in the docs, missing tests where docs require them.
   - **P2**: design smells, missing error handling, important style violations, maintainability issues that will bite later.
   - **P3**: nits, formatting, naming preferences, optional improvements.

   **Summary section** at the end:

   ```
   ## Overall Summary

   ### Statistics
   - Files reviewed: X
   - Files with issues: Y
   - Total issues: Z (P1: a, P2: b, P3: c)
   - By category: Architecture (N), Style (N), Testing (N), etc.

   ### P1 — Critical (must fix before commit)
   1. [Issue with file:line reference]
   2. [Issue with file:line reference]

   ### P2 — Important (should fix)
   1. [Issue with file:line reference]

   ### P3 — Minor (nice to have)
   1. [Issue with file:line reference]

   ### Recommendations
   - [High-level patterns to improve]
   ```

   **LIST EVERY ISSUE.** Do not drop P3 items. Do not say "and N more minor issues". If the review found 40 issues, the report contains 40 entries.

</instructions>

<rules>
- **ALWAYS grep docs when uncertain** - don't guess at rules
- Be thorough - check against ALL standards in docs
- Quote specific doc sections when citing violations
- Include line numbers for all issues
- Categorize every issue as P1 (critical), P2 (important), or P3 (minor) using the definitions in the instructions
- For tests, enforce project-specific fixture and data-generation rules when documented
- Verify claims by reading the actual code changes
- If uncertain whether something violates docs, grep first
</rules>

<output-format>
Use clear markdown with:
- Proper headings (##, ###, ####)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold** for P1 issues
- File paths with line numbers (path/to/file.java:123)
- Direct quotes from docs when citing violations
</output-format>

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
